# Analysis_of_banking_sector
Overview

This project delves into advanced financial analysis and risk assessment methodologies within the banking sector. By leveraging Python and key data science techniques, the study provides a comprehensive evaluation of banking institutions based on key financial indicators, risk metrics, and predictive modeling. The primary objective is to develop a data-driven approach to assess bank stability, creditworthiness, and operational efficiency.

Key Features

1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning: Automated pipelines to collect, preprocess, and clean financial datasets from multiple sources.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth statistical and graphical analysis of key financial metrics.

3. Financial Ratio Analysis: Computation of critical banking ratios, including Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), Non-Performing Assets (NPA), Return on Assets (ROA), and Net Interest Margin (NIM).

4. Risk Assessment Model: Implementation of credit risk modeling techniques using logistic regression, decision trees, and deep learning models.

5. Predictive Modeling: Development of machine learning models for forecasting bank performance based on historical financial data.

6. Visualization & Reporting: Interactive dashboards and financial heatmaps for insightful analysis.

Technologies Used

1. Programming Language: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow)

2. Data Handling: SQL, CSV, JSON

3. Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash

4. Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks

5. Deployment: Jupyter Notebook, Flask (if applicable for web integration)
